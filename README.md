# 🏖️ potential-memory: a custom kernel from scratch 🏖️
### Why
Creating kernel from the ground up will let me implement my own goals for an operating system (see below). **A kernel is just compiled C linked w/ some assembly right?** 🫤🫤🫤 - gets loaded into memory and the rest is up to the OS designer. First step completed. Running on VirtualBox:

### Goals
- implement my own memory allocation method
- write scheduler and get super crazy w/ it 
- add additional security checks
